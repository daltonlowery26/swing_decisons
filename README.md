# Value of Hitter Swing Decisons

## Road Map

- Value of a swing in each zone in each for each hitter
  - leauge average value, because I dont care about swing outcomne this stat trys to measure decisons
  - this could be problematic because some hitters are better at hitting other things
  - gonna try leauge avg first then explore
- diffrence in outcome value vs swing value
- this is count dependent
  - for example to swing 0-0 the outcome has to better then 0-1 expected value if strike or 1-0 if ball

## Usefullness

- Based on vibes I think this will correlate better with K% and BB%
